Desktop wallet performance optimizations to reduce excessive load.

Do not allow login using passphrase to a non-existing account to prevent users
from losing their funds due to a typo. Use the "choose your own passphrase"
link under "create new account" if you really need to login to a non-existing
account using passphrase.

Client UI enhancements and bugfixes.
